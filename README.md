#### Motivation
Everyone in the stock market has his/her own strategies. Most of them are quite simple, because we human can not handle complicated information effectivly or at least not stable like the computer. Some people are using their analytical thinking, some are using instinct, others by courage...I mean the different traders are also components of the unpredictable market.

There are thousands of factors that will influence the stock market. People like from wall street are using abstruse mathematical formulas and models to predict the market in order to maximize the profit. It's a asymmetric warfare, because they acquire more information quickly as the normal trader, they own super computers and super prediction programs, and most of all they have a huge amount of capital.

Fortunately, it's for them not easy at all handling billions of money so flexible as the normal trader. The random factors are influencing the market and making rational predictions difficult. So what if we consider the trading on the stock market is just a game of probability? 

Actually I am trading stocks using quite simple strategy for years and made a few money. However I am not sure wheather the "theory" works as is or works only in some certain market/condition or it was just luck. One day I realized, I could validate my strategies by simulating the trading. I mean buy and sell stocks with the same strategy and the same time period. My tests will not be senseless if I could prove that the probability of the win and lose are actually equal or not predictable at all.

#### Introduction
I want to develope a program to simulate the stock trading using designed strategies and history data with the help of the yahoo finance api. This program will not only be used to simulate the rational and complicated strategies but also every possible simple or even meaningless approaches such as random trading or trading without watching the price fluctuation...
