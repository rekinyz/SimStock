#### Motivation
There are thousands of factors that will influence the stock market which will make it unpredictable. People like from wall street are using abstruse mathematical formulas and models to predict the market in order to maximize the profit. It's a asymmetric warfare, because they acquire more information quickly as the normal trader, they own super computers and super prediction programs and most of all they have a huge amount of capital.

Fortunately there are also random factors making rational predictions difficult even for the profis. So what if we consider the trading on the stock market is just a game of probability? Actually I am trading stocks using my designed simple strategy based on the probability theory for years with small success. However I am not sure wheather the "theory" works as is or works only under certain condition or it was just luck. One day I realized, maybe I could validate my strategies by simulating them. I mean buy and sell stocks with the same strategy and the same time period and then see whether they are able to make stable profit. The tests will not be senseless if I could prove that the probability of the win and lose are actually equal or unpredictable/unstable at all.

#### Introduction
I want to develope a program to simulate the stock trading using designed strategies and history data with the help of the yahoo finance api. This program will not only be used to simulate the rational strategies but also every simple or even meaningless approaches such as random trading or trading without watching the price fluctuation etc...
