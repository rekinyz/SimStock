#### Motivation
Everyone in the stock market has his/her own strategies. They are almost without exception all simple, because we human can not handle complicated information effectivly or at least not stable like the computer. Some people are using their analytical thinking, some are using instinct, others by courage...I'm not laugthing at them, I mean they are also the components of the unpredictable market. The point is some of them are making money. Are they just lucky? 

I am not naive, I know there are thousands of factors that will influence the stock market. The people like from wall street are using abstruse mathematical formulas and models to predict the market in order to maximize the profit. It's a asymmetric warfare, because they acquire more information quickly as the normal trader, they own super computers and super prediction programs, and most of all they have a huge amount of capital.

Fortunately, it's for them not easy at all handling billions of money so flexible as the normal trader. They are too huge to easily become a target. There are so many random factors influence the market that they can not predict and react in time. As long as the random factors exist, no prediction could really be secure. So what if we consider the trading on the stock market is just a game of probability or gamble? 

Actually I am trading stocks using quite simple strategy for years and made a few money. The similar strategy I also have used in the casino. As you guessed, I made a few money again. But I am not a typical gambler at all, in fact I am a very conservative person. I am not sure wheather the "theory" works as is or works only in some certain market/condition or it was just luck. 

One day I realized, I could validate my strategies by simulating the trading again. I mean what if I buy and sell other stocks with the same strategy and the same time period. My test will not be senseless even if I could only prove that the probability of the win and lose are actually equal.

#### Introduction
I want to develope a program to simulate the stock trading using designed strategies and history data with the help of the yahoo finance api. This program will not only be used to simulate my own strategies but also every possible simple approaches such as random trading or trading with or without watching the price fluctuation...
